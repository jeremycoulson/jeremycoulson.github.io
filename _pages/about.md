My research interests are in the area of systems and control theory. I am interested in data-driven control and machine learning with applications in robotics and energy systems. I study fundamental questions arising when using data for prediction and design of safe and reliable control algorithms for complex systems.

In 2015 I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering from Queen's University Canada. I received my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Queen's University Canada in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Bahman Gharesifard and Prof. Abdol-Reza Mansouri. I received my PhD from the [Automatic Control Lab](https://control.ee.ethz.ch) at ETH Z&uuml;rich under the supervision of Prof. Florian D&ouml;rfler and Prof. John Lygeros in 2022.
